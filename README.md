# Ember-cli-fullpagejs-view

I integrated the nice looking (fullPage.js)[http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/] library into the (Bitzik)[bitzik.com] front end and thought there might be someone else out there who might benefice from it.

PR are welcome, issues reporting too (even better if you report the solution as well!)

This is my first Ember-addon, do not hesitate to come up with suggestions/correction to make it more conventional.

Happy Ember coding!
