Null or empty selector will default to `this.$()`\r\n  - `customInitialization`: function that will be called when initizalising fullpage (i.e. `on('didInsertElement')`)\r\n  - `customRemoval`: function that will be called once the addon has tried to clean up any trace of fullpage presence. If you find something that was forgotten put it here (or fill in an issue / send me a PR !)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
